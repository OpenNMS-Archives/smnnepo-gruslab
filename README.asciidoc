= Gru's Lab
:icons: font

Gru's Lab is a testing and demonstration environment for +SMNepO+.
It simulates a complex network with a central +OpenNMS+ instance and multiple sites having seperated infrastructure and services.

== Functional overview
The following figure describes the test scenario to simulate.

image:images/overview.png[Overview ]

=== The Network Operation Center (NOC)
 * Runs an OpenNMS instance
 * Uses ActiveMQ as a messaging server

=== The Store
 * Runs up to 10 nodes
 * Runs one minion (to manage all nodes)
 * Needs a VPN connection to the NOC (reserved)
 * Needs a "public" connection to the internet
 * A node is not reachable from the outside (E.g. the internet or the NOC)
 * All nodes within a store can see/ping each other.

If there are multiple stores, each store is build exactly the same (even the ip addresses match).

Each node must run

  * snmp agent
  * some java application to collect jmx data
  * send traps to NOC

== Technical overview
The environment is simulated virtual machines controlled by http://vagrantup.com[vagrant].
Vagrant is responsible for creating and provisioning the machines and create and wire-up the virtual network.

To simulate the network, internal-only networks between the virtual machines are used.
These networks are not accesible from the host and allow isulation of the transmited data.

For wiring the different networks, a special virtual machine called +router+ is used.
The router is responsible for passing traffic between the networks.


== Network overview
The +core+ network contains the central +OpenNMS+ instance and is reachable by all sites via the +router+.

For each site, a seperate site network exists.
These networks contains a +SMNnepO+ +Minion+ instance which is able to communicate with the central +OpenNMS+ instance via the +router+.


== Usage
NOTE: All commands must be executed from the project folder.


=== Starting
To start the whole lab with all machines, the following command can be used:

----
vagrant up
----


=== Stoping
To shut down all machines from the lab, the following command can be used:

----
vagrant destroy -f
----
